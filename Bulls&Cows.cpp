//You are playing the Bulls and Cows game with your friend.

//You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

//The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
//The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.
//Given the secret number secret and your friend's guess guess, return the hint for your friend's guess.
